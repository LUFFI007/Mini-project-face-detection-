# Mini-project-face-detection-
This mini project focuses on implementing a real-time face detection system using the OpenCV library in Python. The application captures video from the webcam, detects human faces in the video feed using a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier, and allows users to capture snapshots of detected faces.
